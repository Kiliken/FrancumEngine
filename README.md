# Francum Engine

**A frank, portable, and lightweight game engine in OpenGL.**

Francum Engine is built for developers who want to start creating immediately. It is "Frankly Portable"—the repository comes pre-bundled with its own toolchain (Compiler, Build System, and Scripting), meaning you can build and run games on any Windows machine without installing external software.
